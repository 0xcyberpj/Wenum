# Wenum - Website Enumeration ðŸŒŒ

While testing a website our option after Reconnaissance would be Scanning/Enumeration. We have our very own checklist of tools to perform active enumeration on websites. Since time management is a crucial part while Pentesting a website , Wenum provides a hassle free experience. Opening each tool, running enumeration ,saving it in a file and filtering for different types of vulnerability testing made me a bit lazy. All I wish is to enter a domain name and every process involved in enumeration comes handy. Thus I made Wenum.

Wenum is a combination of enumeration tools which are already available.
